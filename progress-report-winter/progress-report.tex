	\maketitle

		\begin{abstract}The purpose of this project is to produce an iOS/Android application for Calvary Chapel of Corvallis that will allow members to access a plethora of information all in one localized space.
		The Church's current website does not provide an interface where current members of the church can very quickly access important information such as events, bulletins, and messages from the service.
		The desired application will be simple enough for anyone to use while providing back end access for staff to easily upload new information to the app.
		The priorities lie in maximizing the usability of the app and providing bulletin, schedule, video, and giving functionality.
		We will work with the existing Calvary Chapel web development team to create a product that is seamlessly integrated with their already existing network.

		\section{Purpose and Goals}
		The purpose of our project is to create an application for Calvary Corvallis Church that will act as a connection between the congregation and the administration.
		The church already has a website that has some of this information, but they want the website and app to serve different functions. 
		The website will be to introduce people to the church.
		The app will be used for the existing congregation as the go to place to access the most commonly used or needed information.
		Some of the features being provided within the app are: having sermons available, listing the bulletin, having the church schedule, and allowing members to donate to the church.
		Our client explained to us that these were the features that they wanted in the app as they are the most needed services by their members.

		Our client has requested that the app be as automated as possible in regards to updating the information hosted within it as to reduce any upkeep as much as possible.
		So we will be working with their existing infrastructure as much as possible to pull our information from.
		We are also creating both an iOS and Android application and we want to make the applications as functionally similar as possible.
		This will allow for greater understanding of the app across users who may or may not be super tech savvy.
		Our final goal in this project is to reduce costs wherever possible for our client.
		If that means suggesting newer cheaper infrastructure or setting up our app in a way that reduces how often it will need to be updated, we want to do it.

\section{Fall 2016}
		\subsection{Progress report}
		Currently, we are still in the planning phase of the project. 
		We have just finished the design document which detailed how we plan on implementing our app and how it will be designed. 
		However, we have not begun the actual implementation of either app quite yet. 
		Our immediate plans include extensive research on iOS and Android app development which we will focus on during Winter break.
		
		\subsection{Problems}
		One of the first issues we ran into was the fact that there are multiple platforms to run an app on. 
		At first our client did not know, but it became quickly apparent that they wanted their app to be available to all their members. 
		This meant that we had to switch from creating just one app, to developing two apps that will perform the same task. This adds a substantial amount of work to our project. 
		We are looking into coding platforms that will allow us to reuse some of our code if possible but it seems we will just need to budget more time to this project to develop for both Android and IOS. 

	The rest of our problems ended up being small things like needing to change the name of the project in the requirements doc or figuring out which platform we will be coding on. 
	These all had simple solutions like going in and adjusting the name and looking up the pros and cons of the different platforms. 
	Occasionally we had the problem of running a little close on the due date of papers and had a struggle of getting them out and signed in time. 
	This was solved by communicating with our client in advance so they knew we were on a tight timeline and having quick turnaround on when the documents were sent and received. 

	Finally, our last thing we need to work on is learning about app development. 
	Notice, I did not say that this was a problem. 
	I would say it is more of a hurdle that we need to get over. 
	We have all of winter break to get the fundamentals down along with starting the framework of our app. 
	I think come early January that we will be set up well with our project. 
	
	
\section{Winter 2017}

	\subsection{Courtney Bonn}
	At the beginning of this term, I had a hard time getting started on this project for many different reasons.
	First off, though it was encouraged, I ended up not being able to work on research or the project itself during Winter break due to family obligations and working. 
	Not doing any of the research I had hoped to do meant I felt behind before the term even began. 
	Second off, the research and learning how to use Xcode and Android Studio has been much harder than I expected. 
	
	During the first week of school I was able to get Android Studio downloaded and began working with the program. 
	Because I'm also in Mobile Development, we are using Android Studio in that class so I began learning Android studio in an assignment for that class. 
	We also began the iOS app for our project.
	At first, we decided to focus on one app at a time so we would not overwhelm ourselves and we decided to go with iOS first. 
	Kevin was able to get a skeleton iOS app that we were able to pull to our local computers from Git and successfully run and view updates from each other. 
	This week I got in touch with our client, whom we had not spoken to the entirety of Winter break. 
	We updated her on our progress, letting her know that we have just started on the projects. 
	At this point we agreed that we did not need to meet face-to-face because neither the client nor us had any deliverables to show each other at this time. 
	
	In week 2 I shifted my focus to Xcode and learning Swift. 
	While Swift is similar to other languages I have learned, I have never coded in it and still need to learn the proper syntax. 
	Not only did I need to learn Swift, I also had to learn how to use a new interface--Xcode. 
	I began following a Swift tutorial provided by Apple that helps users learn how to use Xcode and build a Food Tracker app. 
	I did not finish the tutorial, but I got far enough in it to assist me in working on our own application.
	I also did some additional research on the church's new website. 
	The new website seemed to be a Wordpress website, which would help in terms of pulling information from the website directly to the app. 
	Before I did anymore research on using Wordpress' API, I emailed our client to verify that I was correct and that we would be able to have access to the Wordpress site if needed. 
	If I am correct and we are able to pull from Wordpress' API, the web development team would only have to update their website as normal and the changes would be reflected in the app. 
	At this point I decided to wait until I heard back from the client and then I would continue researching how to use Wordpress' API. 
	
	The third week of term is the first week I actually began working on the iOS app. 
	My goal was to get Calvary's logo up on each page. 
	While this seems like it would be an easy task, it actually was rather difficult and took me two days to accurately do it. 
	In order to have the images show up centered on every device and not just the device I was working with, I had to use constraints on the images. 
	I was having trouble setting the constraints correctly and the images were not in the same spot on every page. 
	Eventually, I was able to successfully get the logo centered on the top of each page in the app and it will stay centered no matter what the screen size is. 
	I received confirmation from our client that the new website is Wordpress and we can have access to its API. 
	The client will work on getting us access to the Wordpress site and until then I will continue researching how to use its API. 
	
	As of week 4, we are still waiting on the Wordpress credentials from the client. 
	In order to not lose much more time and get behind, I began working on getting a JSON parser up on the bulletin page. 
	After much research online, I was able to find a simple JSON parser. 
	Using the parser to have the JSON data print to the console was easy, but figuring out how to display the data on the app itself took quite a while. 
	Eventually I figured out how to display the data and now it is printing onto a large TextView.
	For now, I am pulling the data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 which is just a website that allows users to test puling JSON data. 
	Currently all that is displayed is a title and description, though they are both in latin. 
	Even though it is not usable information, once we obtain the Wordpress API we will be able to replace the above URL and pull the correct information. 
	
	At this point in the term, our group started to struggle a little bit with the development. 
	We had not started the Android app so we were feeling very behind and not sure how we would successfully finish both apps in less than two months. 
	Max discovered an issue with our storyboard that was greatly affecting his ability to add code to any app page past page two and this problem took a while to diagnose. 
	Once we figured out what was wrong, Max was easily able to finish his task on the iOS app. 
	We gathered our confidence back, but we still knew we were behind in the Android portion. 
	I started the Android app and created all five pages we needed. 
	This took longer than I expected because adding pages to an Android app is not as straightforward as it is in Xcode. 
	I was also able to implement a sidebar navigation which pointed to each page. 
	I am still doing research on how to parse and display JSON data using a REST API. 
	The information I find regarding this subject is more complex than is needed for our project, so I have not been able to solve this part quite yet. 
	
	Coming up in our project is finishing each page and working on getting the Wordpress API information from the client. 
	We also need to set up user studies to test our interface. 
	It is too early right now to set these up since the basic functionality of each app has not been completed yet. 
	My prediction is we will finish the iOS app sooner than we will finish the Android app, which will allow us to focus our attention on the Android app. 
	Our client would also like us to research if we would be able to offer the applications in different languages. 
	At the very least they would like the welcome message on the homepage to be presented in several different languages. 
	After we have the basic functionality finished on the apps, we can decide if we are able to offer different languages for the app. 
	
	
	\subsection{Max Dimm}
	Ok to recap briefly what our project is about, we are working with Calvary Corvallis to create both an IOS and Android app that will work independent of the website to be the connection tool between the congregation and the church. 
This app will deliver the most pertinent information to the members of the church in one easy to understand and centralized location. We are making both of the apps natively and will be trying to keep the interfaces as similar as possible. 

	All of our group members started this project with little to no app development experience. 
This made starting the project pretty daunting as we had not taken on something like this before. Our progress was slow at first but in retrospect I think that makes sense. 
It takes a while to get your reigns about a project and start to understand the language you are using. 
It took until about week 3 to start seeing major changes in our skeleton version of the app. 
I spent a lot of time personally watching Youtube tutorials and reading online resources about coding in swift. 

On my end I am in charge of primarily working on the sermons page and partially on the donations page. 
The purposes of those pages are to allow the users to view live and past sermons from within the app, and to be able to donate to Calvary Corvallis directly. 
Originally I had a good idea of what I wanted to do with our project but struggled with an issue of our viewcontrollers not being connected to our story board in x-code. 
This made implementing what I wanted to do difficult as I spent over a week trying to diagnose the issue which was more difficult than expected because of my lack of background knowledge.  
Week four I was able to figure out the problem and get it set back on track. 
As of right now I have the video functionality up and working on our app and am working on the user’s ability to navigate past sermons. 
One issue I’m currently facing is the live functionality is something that the video hosting service will not allow without a more premium membership from Calvary Corvallis. 
So I spoke with their tech team and they are working on finding a solution to that for me. 
They explained that they will either be upgrading their account to allow live functionality, or also hosting their videos on another platform like Youtube to allow the users to watch their sermons live. 

So as stated above I am still working on getting the navigation of past sermons onto the page below the player, but believe I have recently discovered the method I will be using to implement it. 
I want to test my method on a separate project I have been working on alongside our primary one. 
This is what I would describe as my testing grounds and allows me to remove code and make more drastic changes without affecting our main project.

	\subsection{Extra}
	
	This stuff is from the progress report sent to Vee. We'll want to reword everything into our own sections above. 
	
		In the past few weeks, we have begun the development of the iOS Application. 
		It took about two weeks to get the basic skeleton up and running with each page set up with it's own View Controller. 
		Once the outline was taken care of, we added Calvary Corvallis' logo to each page of the application.
		On the Bulletin page, we have added code to fetch and parse JSON data and print it onto the app. 
		Just recently we were given administrative access to Church Community Builder's API. 
		There was a delay in getting this information, so that has slowed progress. 
		Once that information was received, we began working on fetching the Calendar data so that can be printed onto the app. 
		We are also waiting for the administrative access to the church's Wordpress API, which, once received, will replace the current JSON data that is being printed on the bulletin page. 
		The donation page will be a UIWebView that connects to their existing donation platform, Authorize.net. 
		The messages page will be a UIWebView where the video of the most recent message will play. 
		
		Currently, we have not started development on the Android application. 
		Rather than trying to completely finish the iOS application first, as was our original plan, we are now going to begin the implementation of the Android app concurrently. 
		
		Despite the overall simplicity of the applications we are planning, we have run in to quite a few issues since starting development. 
		First off, mobile development is much harder than any of us had anticipated. 
		While we are familiar with many coding languages, learning a new language (Swift) has taken more time than expected. 
		Secondly, we have not had the information we need from our client as quickly as we need it. 
		While the client has been very good at getting back to us, she is coordinating with other people in her own team who have not always responded right away. 
		This issue led us not getting access to the required APIs until week 4. 
		Currently, we are still waiting for access to the Wordpress API which has stalled part of the iOS app. 
		
		When developing the video player on the sermons page Max ran into issues with linking the storyboard ViewControllers to the actual viewcontroller codebases. 
		This took a while for him to diagnose the issue as he had not worked with xcode or swift before and had a hard time locating resources to troubleshoot the problem. 
		He was able to figure out the issue by week 4 and quickly implement the desired function because he had worked on it in a seperate project file.
		However this did take a significant portion of time off the table for him.
		
		Finally, we have not even begun the Android development portion of this application. 
		After doing a lot of research in the beginning of this project, we decided to implement two native applications, rather than attempting a cross-development app. 
		While this is giving us the opportunity to learn both iOS and Android development, it has also proven to be more time-consuming and work than we imagined. 
		At this point in the project, it is not ideal to switch to a cross-development platform versus continuing to develop both native applications at the same time.
