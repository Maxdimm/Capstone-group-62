		\begin{abstract}The purpose of this project is to produce an iOS/Android application for Calvary Chapel of Corvallis that will allow members to access a plethora of information all in one localized space. 
		The Church's current website doesn't provide an interface where current members of the church can very quickly access important information such as events, bulletins, and messages from the service. 
		The desired application will be simple enough for anyone to use while providing back end access for staff to easily upload new information to the app. 
		The priorities lie in maximizing the usability of the app and providing bulletin, schedule, video, and donation functionality. 
		We will work with the existing Calvary Chapel web development team to create a product that is seamlessly integrated with their already existing network.
