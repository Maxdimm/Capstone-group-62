		\begin{abstract}The purpose of this project is to produce an iOS/Android application for Calvary Chapel of Corvallis that will allow members to access a plethora of information all in one localized space. 
		The Church's current website doesn't provide an interface where current members of the church can very quickly access important information such as events, bulletins, and messages from the service. 
		The desired application will be simple enough for anyone to use while providing back end access for staff to easily upload new information to the app. 
		The priorities lie in maximizing the usability of the app and providing bulletin, schedule, video, and donation functionality. 
		We will work with the existing Calvary Chapel web development team to create a product that is seamlessly integrated with their already existing network.

	\section*{Problem Definition}
		With smartphones at the tip of almost everyone's fingers, phone applications have become a large part of the world of web development. 
	Most websites desire to have an application available for their users so people can easily access the main parts of the website. 
	This project focuses on connecting the members of Calvary Chapel Corvallis to a simple, user friendly application available on both iOS and Android phones. 

	Currently, Calvary Chapel Corvallis has a website that provides a copious amount of information about the church. 
	Some of this information is mainly focused on introducing new members to the ongoings of the church, while some is geared towards the current members.
	What the website doesn't provide is a centralized location that houses all of the most important information that current members of the church would be interested in quickly accessing.
	What is needed is a simple application that enables members to listen to recent messages, view upcoming events and sign up to volunteer, read the current e-bulletin, and quickly donate to the church. 
	Additionally, the employees of the church need to be able to easily update the calendar, upload new bulletins and messages, and apply these changes to the application using their current management software. 
	The application would need to include the ability to display the live-stream to the members who are unable to be physically present. 
	Finally, members need access to the Bible, which should be integrated into the app, so that they can follow along during the service.
